To reset the password

Follow these steps (can be helpful if you really forget your password and you can try it anytime, even if you're not in the situation at the moment):

    Stop mysql

    sudo /etc/init.d/mysql stop

    Or for other distribution versions:

    sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld stop

    Start MySQL in safe mode

    sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &

    Log into MySQL using root

    mysql -uroot

    Select the MySQL database to use

    use mysql;

    Reset the password

    update user set password=PASSWORD("mynewpassword") where User='root';

    Flush the privileges

    flush privileges;

    Restart the server

    quit

    Stop and start the server again

    Ubuntu and Debian:

    sudo /etc/init.d/mysql stop
    ...
    sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start

    On CentOS, Fedora, and RHEL:

    sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld stop
    ...
    sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld start

    Login with a new password

    mysql -u root -p

    Type the new password and enjoy your server again like nothing happened
